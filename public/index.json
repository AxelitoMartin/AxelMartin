Originally developed for cancer genomics with delayed entry in the risk set in mind, and thus can adjust for left-truncation. OncoCast enables users to easily perform one or multiple machine learning survival analyses at once and explore and visualize the resulting output.\nInstalling OncoCast OncoCast has some dependencies that will be installed if they are not found in your library.

They will be guided through:\nGenerating data in a ready for analysis format where the users will be guided on how to format their data to use OncoCast. Performing an ensemble learning run through a guide of the different machine learning algorithms available and how to create an ensemble model. Generating comprehensible results with a tutorial on how to explore the predicted risk score of patients in the dataset, the prognostic power of the ensemble model, the importance of each feature of interest and how to optimize creation of risk groups in clinically meaningful subsets. Using web-based interactive applications to simplify the exploration of results and sharing them collaborators. OncoCast Online There exist a version of OncoCast completely web-based requiring no coding skills and minimal inputs to create and explore an ensemble model.

Multi-type genomic data arise from the experiments where biological samples (e.g., tumor samples) are analyzed by multiple techniques, for instance, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), gene expression microarray, RNA-seq and DNA-seq, and so on.

In this paper we introduce two fairness criteria for GLMs based on equalizing expected outcomes or log-likelihoods. We prove that for GLMs both criteria can be achieved via a convex penalty term based solely on the linear components of the GLM, thus permitting efficient optimization. We also derive theoretical properties for the resulting fair GLM estimator. To empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed fair GLM, we compare it with other well-known fair prediction methods on an extensive set of benchmark datasets for binary classification and regression. In addition, we demonstrate that the fair GLM can generate fair predictions for a range of response variables, other than binary and continuous outcomes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Fair Generalized Linear Models with a Convex Penalty","type":"publication"}]
